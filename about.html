        <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
        
        <p>The rise of IoT, edge computing, and Industry 4.0 has driven the demand for secure 
            and real-time capable gateways that can ensure safe and efficient communication 
            between embedded devices and cloud services. Smart Safe Gateways powered by 
            Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) present a crucial intersection of safety, 
            real-time performance, and robust security, serving as a backbone for 
            mission-critical applications in sectors like automotive, healthcare, and industrial automation.
            With the upcoming European Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), the focus will shift to 
            strengthening cybersecurity requirements for digital products and connected devices. 
            The CRA emphasizes the need for secure-by-design principles, continuous updates, 
            and resilience against cyber threats. The workshop will delve into how these 
            evolving regulations impact the design and deployment of RTOS-based smart gateways, 
            aligning technical advancements with regulatory compliance.
            This workshop aims to explore the latest advancements, challenges, and research directions 
            in the field of smart safe gateways running RTOS. It will serve as a platform for industry 
            experts, researchers, and practitioners to discuss the integration of RTOS with secure gateway 
            technologies, address the safety and security challenges, and propose innovative solutions 
            for reliable data transmission and device management.
