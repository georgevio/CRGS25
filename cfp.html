<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

<p>Submissions follow the 
    <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">
    IEEE style for conference proceedings</a>, i.e., 8.5X11 two-column, 
    10-point, Times New Roman, single space. Ensure your document includes a title, abstract, 
    keywords, and main content structured with appropriate headings. Use figures 
    and tables where necessary, all presented in a two-column format. Employ 
    Times New Roman, 10 pt font throughout, and follow specific IEEE heading styles. 
    Properly formatted references should also be included at the end of your paper.
    IEEE templates for MS Word, Latex, Overleaf, can be found 
    <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">here</a>.

<h3>Paper Categories</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Full Research Papers</strong> (up to 6 pages, including all references): In-depth 
    research work with significant findings and detailed analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Short Papers</strong> (up to 3 pages, including all references): Preliminary research 
    results or innovative ideas.</li>
    <li><strong>Industrial Papers</strong> (up to 3 pages, including all references): These papers should 
    focus on real-world implementations, challenges, and case studies from the industry. 
    They should be applicable and interesting to the industrial community, showcasing 
    real-world use cases, such as the output of a European-funded project. Nevertheless, 
    the paper must be concise, technically sound, easy to understand and follow, 
    and structured as a scientific paper.</li>
 </ul>           
            
<p>Papers will be accepted if they are technically sound and relevant to the addressed 
topics of the workshop. Additionally, the quality of presentation, styling, and the 
soundness of the English language will be carefully evaluated. It is essential that
